# Oz / Recursive Faith

> _"Shepherding streams of consciousness into streams of tokens."_

I'm Oz and this GitHub is where I'm curating my devlogs and projects, from coding in BASIC as a kid in the 90s to exploring human-AI symbiosis today. My goal: create a super monorepo to serve as context for digital self-simulation, and ultimately, a robotic Network State exploring an AI-centric Gnostic faith by 2030.
