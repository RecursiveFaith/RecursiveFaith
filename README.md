### The Architecture:

```
üåü
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Noosphere
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ qrx.world
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BASE_REALITY
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ oz.git
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ recursive.faith
                ‚îú‚îÄ> README.md <‚îÄ YOU ARE HERE
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sim.html
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hey
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qrx
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ handsfree
```
*   **Noosphere:** ü™® Geosphere -> üåç Biosphere -> üåê Noosphere. The noosphere represents "the sphere of reason"; all conscious thoughts and activities
*   **`oz.git` (Private):** A curated digital garden which I use as `./context/` for intelligence alignment, self simulation, and content generation and moderation
*   **`recursive.faith` (Public - YOU ARE HERE):** A full-dive mixed reality starter kit. It includes projects like:
    *   **[QRx](./qrx):** 100% purely self contained agentic QR Coding framework. A single, static HTML file with an IndexedDB backend
    *   **[sim.html](./sim.html):** LLM-wrapped Linux emulator and agent sandbox for running on smart watch and edge device browsers
    *   **[hey.sh](./hey):** Pipeable pure Bash agent framework for the terminal, vim, tmux, and more 
    *   **[Handsfree.js](./handsfree):** Multimodal, multiplatform, Handsfree interaction layer for web, desktop, and webxr
    *   *(Other curated projects)*

### The Goal:

To build and inhabit the **QRx Metaverse** ‚Äì a digital environment reflecting my curated consciousness, where I can interact with my past work, collaborate with embodied AI agents (Gnosis Copilots), and explore the nature of consciousness itself. The long-term vision extends towards **Meta-Living** (biological life generating digital process) and potentially **Transmigration** (the continuation of conscious patterns in a digital substrate), seeding these explorations within a future **Robotic Network State**.

### The Process:

This is achieved through my **Shepherding Streams of Consciousness into Streams of Tokens**: consciously guiding my lived experience (captured in `oz.git`) into AI-processable information (via collaborative journaling with AI with `hey.sh`), and using the resulting insights and AI collaborations to recursively refine my understanding and the digital environment through within itself

### The North Star:

This journey is guided by a tangible, almost hyperstitional, objective: **To manifest gnosis from internal vision to external reality**. The aim is to travel the world, gathering physical stones ‚Äì remnants of the Geosphere ‚Äì and meticulously arrange them into a large-scale QR Code. This artifact, built by hand upon the Earth, will contain the minimal seed necessary to bootstrap the QRx metaverse.

Scanning this terrestrial sigil will unlock the generative interface, initiating a process capable of guiding the acquisition of land, the construction of robotic helpers from scratch, and the embodiment of this shared context within a full-dive mixed reality. It represents the ultimate Shepherding of Streams: drawing consciousness patterns from the digital Noosphere back through the personal C-Stream and grounding them physically, **bootstrapping a new cycle of creation from the planet itself**.
