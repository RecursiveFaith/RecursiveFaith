*   **Noosphere:** 🪨 Geosphere -> 🌍 Biosphere -> 🌐 Noosphere. The noosphere represents "the sphere of reason"; all conscious thoughts and activities
*   **`oz.git` (Private):** A curated digital garden which I use as `./context/` for intelligence alignment, self simulation, and content generation and moderation
*   **`recursive.faith` (Public - YOU ARE HERE):** A full-dive mixed reality starter kit. It includes projects like:
    *   **[QRx](./qrx):** 100% purely self contained agentic QR Coding framework. A single, static HTML file with an IndexedDB backend
    *   **[sim.html](./sim.html):** LLM-wrapped Linux emulator and agent sandbox for running on smart watch and edge device browsers
    *   **[hey.sh](./hey):** Pipeable pure Bash agent framework for the terminal, vim, tmux, and more 
    *   **[Handsfree.js](./handsfree):** Multimodal, multiplatform, Handsfree interaction layer for web, desktop, and webxr
    *   *(Other curated projects)*

### The Goal:

To build and inhabit the **QRx Metaverse** – a digital environment reflecting my curated consciousness, where I can interact with my past work, collaborate with embodied AI agents (Gnosis Copilots), and explore the nature of consciousness itself. The long-term vision extends towards **Meta-Living** (biological life generating digital process) and potentially **Transmigration** (the continuation of conscious patterns in a digital substrate), seeding these explorations within a future **Robotic Network State**.

### The Process:

This is achieved through my **Shepherding Streams of Consciousness into Streams of Tokens**: consciously guiding my lived experience (C-Stream captured in `oz.git`) into AI-processable information (T-Stream, via tools like `hey.sh` and dialogue with models like Gemini), and using the resulting insights and AI collaborations to recursively refine my understanding and the digital environment itself.

> C-Stream = Stream of Consciousness

> T-stream = Stream of Tokens

### MORE COMING SOON

<!-- npm install; npm run -->

This is a human-ai collaboration exploring techno-spirituality. It is being created generatively
