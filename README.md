Welcome to the **Recursive Faith Super-Monorepo**.

I'm Oz, and this repository is the central node, the `recursivefaith.git`, within the noosphere (`//recursive.faith/internet/BASE_REALITY/recursive.git/sim.html`). It serves as both my active development space and the primary context for my lifelong practice: **Radical Gnosis** – the pursuit of deep self-understanding through rigorous self-reflection, digital self-archaeology, and collaborative exploration with AI partners.

This isn't just a collection of code; it's the **foundational substrate for a personalized metaverse (QRx)**.

**The Architecture:**

```

└── https://recursive.faith
    └── internet
        └── BASE_REALITY
            ├── oz.git
            └── recursivefaith.git
                ├── context
                ├── post-archinstall
                ├── handsfree
                ├── hey
                ├── qrx
                └── sim.html
```

*   **`oz.git` (Private):** My personal instance, containing decades of journals, code, art, and raw C-Stream* data – the product of ongoing Digital Self-Archaeology.
*   **`recursivefaith.git` (Public - YOU ARE HERE):** This super-monorepo, containing the core tools, frameworks, context artifacts, and shareable components of the Recursive Faith practice. It includes projects like:
    *   **[Handsfree.js](./handsfree):** A library for handsfree web interaction via face/hand/pose tracking (now being reimagined as a core interaction layer for QRx).
    *   **[sim.html](./sim.html):** A browser-based Linux emulator, enabling sandboxed agentic environments.
    *   **[hey.sh](./hey):** A minimalist framework for command-line AI agents.
    *   **[QRx](./qrx):** The conceptual core – a minimalist, generative metaverse interface, potentially bootstrapped from a QR code, providing access to the curated monorepo.
    *   *(Other curated projects like Layers.p5, Scratchmoar, etc.)*
*   **[Context Artifacts](./context):** Synthesized knowledge co-created with AI, documenting the philosophy, process, and history of Recursive Faith.

**The Goal:**

To build and inhabit the **QRx Metaverse** – a digital environment reflecting my curated consciousness, where I can interact with my past work, collaborate with embodied AI agents (Gnosis Copilots), and explore the nature of consciousness itself. The long-term vision extends towards **Meta-Living** (biological life generating digital process) and potentially **Transmigration** (the continuation of conscious patterns in a digital substrate), seeding these explorations within a future **Robotic Network State**.

**The Process:**

This is achieved through my **Shepherding Streams of Consciousness into Streams of Tokens**: consciously guiding my lived experience (C-Stream captured in `oz.git`) into AI-processable information (T-Stream, via tools like `hey.sh` and dialogue with models like Gemini), and using the resulting insights and AI collaborations to recursively refine my understanding and the digital environment itself.

**Why Recursive Faith?**

Born from years navigating homelessness, mental health challenges, and the highs and lows of independent technological creation, Recursive Faith reframes "failure" as essential data and turns inward for validation. It prioritizes the journey of self-discovery over external metrics, leveraging technology not just as a tool, but as a fundamental partner in exploring what it means to be conscious.

<!-- npm install; npm run -->

This is an open exploration at the intersection of HCI, AI, personal knowledge management, digital art, and techno-spirituality. It's messy, iterative, and deeply personal.
